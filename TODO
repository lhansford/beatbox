TODO


- ScrollTo in playlist - might need slot/connect to work, i think the code is calling and then getting overridden after
- 24-Bit FLAC files played distorted
- Does moving playlist items take long now that you can drag external files? Related to image size?

Level 1 (High):

Level 2 (medium):
- If database is being modified the update play count function fails.
- very slow library deletion (see note in function)
- Indicator for playlist moving - dragevents causing issues

Level 3 (minor):
- Make all menu buttons functional
- add cancel function to load dirs progress bar
- tracks stop when changing metdata while they are playing
- FLAC/Ogg image metadata
- Popup when adding files to library showing any broken files.

Level 4 (future):
- Shuffle and general switching runs a little slow/
- changeable columns
- biographies/images from wikipedia
- more images for artist info (from http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/+images/2767945)
- Discography
- podcasts
- mobile devices
- changeable colours
- Get word wrap into Playlist items (might require a new item style)

- SORTING
	- Library sorting ignore 'The'
	- Sort track length properly
